This is an implementation of an elevator system. 
To start the system, do 
    `python3 elevator.py`
to issue requests to the system (act as the client), do
    `echo "<request_floor>,<direction("up"/"down")>,<target_floor>" > /tmp/elevator_request_queue`
for example, if you want to go from 3rd flor to 5th floor, you would type
    `echo "3,up,5" > /tmp/elevator_request_queue`

The system checks requests in /tmp/elevator_request_queue periodically.
Configure system wait time, number of elevators, number of floors in elevator.py by chaning the constant values

The system prioritizes elevators that can pick up requests along the way, and then the idle elevators.
If no elevator is idle, and no elevator can pick up the request along the way, then the request is 
marked as unhandled, and will be handled everytime the elevators change their state
